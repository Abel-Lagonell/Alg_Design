# Changelog

0.1 - Just initialized the Node.py class for further study of the grid. The class includes getters and setters, constructor, and a string representation of the Node itself  
0.2 - Node.py: added the setCost function, one more getter function to get if the node was visited or not, a get Distance function that takes in a node to see the distance between them, and a function to help the setCost function to help determine the price range.  
0.3 - Graph.py: Created the file, adding an import plotly. Created a irrelevant graph. Will modify later to add relevant graph.
